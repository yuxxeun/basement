do you remember that night, baby?

a night where we start looking for a place filled with strangers or even almost empty, meanwhile we don't do anything illegal.
haha we're so funny, right?

there are many questions in my mind, why did we start all of this and why?

you opened your mouth and started talking.

and now, I can understand why you'd want to do that.

I didn't know you were in such deep pain, im sorry for that.

you starting telling me the deeper stories, and now I know the truth.

I honestly don't really understand why you choosing me to listen this kind of things, because we technically know each other only a few months.

on the other hand, I'm happy, happy because I can know you more deeper and know what your personality really is.

regardless of why you choosing me, you've done your best.

I'm really remember clearly the warmth of your embrace in that room.

time seemed to pass so quickly.

and now our time has come â€” the time for both of us saying "goodbye".

Sayonara.

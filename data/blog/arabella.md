Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots

And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly

She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit

And when she needs to shelter from reality

She takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when this sunset gets itself

Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side

It's much less picturesque without her catching the light

The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella

Arabella

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul

You can't be sure

Arabella's got a seventies head

But she's a modern lover

It's an exploration, she's made of outer space

And her lips are like the galaxy's edge

And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when this sunset gets itself

Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side

It's much less picturesque without her catching the light

The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella

As Arabella

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul

You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat

Just a slip underneath it I hope

Asking if I can have one of those

Organic cigarettes that she smokes

Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke

Makes you wish that you were the bottle

Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like

I just might have tapped into your mind and soul

You can't be sure

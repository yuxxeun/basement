Echoes of the heart — they say
<br>
Can be heard from far away
<br>
Whispers in the wind, they fly
<br>
Carrying memories of days gone by

The heart beats with a rhythmic sound
<br>
A symphony of joy and pain profound
<br>
It sings of love and despair
<br>
Of the dreams and the hopes that we all share

Echoes of the heart — they tell
<br>
Of tales that weaves and casts a spell
<br>
They echo through the darkest night
<br>
Guiding us with a beacon of light

The heart speaks in a language of truth
<br>
Of all the things we feel and do
<br>
It speaks about our love and our fears
<br>
Of the joy that fills our hearts with cheers

So listen closely, hear the sound
<br>
Of the echoes that abound
<br>
For in the whispers of the heart
<br>
We find the truth, the perfect art

Echoes of the heart — again, they say
<br>
Will always find a gentle way
<br>
To guide us through life's winding path
<br>
And lead us to our dreams at last.
